detect crs type (2 or 32)
detect number of channels
read pulse counter BEFORE stop
multithreading transfer
check if Decode is not overlapped for different cbacks (threads?)

cnt_prev - check counter consistency
also use Counter and cnt for consistency check

Class - data, pulses etc...

Reset

limits of parameters

save/read parameters

check chan for each 2byte or 8byte data (crs2 or crs32)

make flip-flop buffers for Bevents

join all threads at exit

simulate too long pulse in readpulse2 (return 2)

syncronize MAX_XH and MAXCH

make DoReset/greset() - detect crs, clear everything

set chanPresent for open files (no module)

make colors in crspardlg

calculate data rate instantly (between subsequent buffers), not as integral
